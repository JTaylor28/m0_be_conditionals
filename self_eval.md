# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
* they are hard at first, but if i take it slow i start understanding
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
* again, i feel mostly low. For whatever reason, these are hard for me.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
* like a 6/10
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
* 4 hours. Not within my ideal time frame at all
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* for now just doing the homework helps, but I intend on maybe doing extra more Turing classes before mod1. I think my calander needs to offer me more time for things moving forward. 2 house instead of 1 maybe..
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I don't even know what questions to ask at this point, I just just need more practice. If i have questions as ill refer to slack or goodle.
