# Introduce the challenge
# - Demonstrate how to live-code the solution
# - Explain each line of code (this can be done while live-coding or after)
# - Show that the program works as intended by running the code (you should run the code more than once to prove it works for all logic paths)
# - Share a challenge or question you had when you solved it the first time

# Write a Ruby program that defines a variable that stores an Integer. 
#The program should print out the String "even" if the Integer is even, and the String "odd" if the Integer is odd.

number = 5

if number.even?
    puts "even"
else
    puts "odd"
end
